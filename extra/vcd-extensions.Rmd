Notes on some {vcd} and {vcdExtra} functions that could be made more usable, better documented or illustrated in examples

## `vcd::woolf_test()`
## 
Only handles 3-way tables, 2 x 2 x k. Could extend this simply to the 2 x 2 x R x C case by taking all the R x C strata
together, making this into a 2 x 2 x k=R*C table

e.g., for the `Fungicide` data, 2 x 2 x 2 x 2

```{r error=FALSE}
data(Fungicide, package = "vcdExtra")
# rearrange `group` for ease of interpretation, so odds ratio > 1 means worse outcome for Treated group
Fungicide <- Fungicide[2:1, , , ]
ftable(sex + strain ~ outcome + group, data=Fungicide)

oddsratio(Fungicide) |>
  summary()

#' Woolf test only only handles 2 x 2 x k tables
woolf_test(Fungicide)
```
