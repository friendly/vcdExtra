    and the gnm package for Generalized Nonlinear Models.
	In particular, vcdExtra extends mosaic, assoc and sieve plots from vcd to handle glm() and gnm() models and
	adds a 3D version in mosaic3d.  Additionally, methods are provided for comparing and visualizing lists of
	glm and loglm objects.
