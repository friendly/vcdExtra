# Horseshoe Crab Mating

Determinants of mating for male satellites to nesting horseshoe crabs.
The number of `satellites` is a natural outcome variable. This dataset
is useful for exploring various count data models.

## Format

A data frame containing 173 observations on 5 variables.

- `color`:

  Ordered factor indicating color (light medium, medium, dark medium,
  dark).

- `spine`:

  Ordered factor indicating spine condition (both good, one worn or
  broken, both worn or broken).

- `width`:

  Carapace width (cm).

- `weight`:

  Weight (kg).

- `satellites`:

  Number of satellites.

which is not on CRAN

## Details

Brockmann (1996) investigates horseshoe crab mating. The crabs arrive on
the beach in pairs to spawn. Furthermore, unattached males also come to
the beach, crowd around the nesting couples and compete with attached
males for fertilizations. These so-called satellite males form large
groups around some couples while ignoring others. Brockmann (1996) shows
that the groupings are not driven by environmental factors but by
properties of the nesting female crabs. Larger females that are in
better condition attract more satellites.

Agresti (2002, 2013) reanalyzes the number of satellites using count
models. Explanatory variables are the female crab's color, spine
condition, weight, and carapace width. Color and spine condition are
ordered factors but are treated as numeric in some analyses.

## Examples

``` r
# example code
## load data, use ordered factors as numeric, and
## grouped factor version of width
data("CrabSatellites", package = "vcdExtra")
#> Warning: data set 'CrabSatellites' not found
CrabSatellites <- transform(CrabSatellites,
  color = as.numeric(color),
  spine = as.numeric(spine),
  cwidth = cut(width, c(-Inf, seq(23.25, 29.25), Inf))
)
#> Error: object 'CrabSatellites' not found

## Agresti, Table 4.4
aggregate(CrabSatellites$satellites,
          list(CrabSatellites$cwidth), function(x)
  round(c(Number = length(x), Sum = sum(x), Mean = mean(x), Var = var(x)), digits = 2))
#> Error: object 'CrabSatellites' not found

## Agresti, Figure 4.4
plot(tapply(satellites, cwidth, mean) ~ tapply(width, cwidth, mean),
  data = CrabSatellites,
  ylim = c(0, 6), pch = 19, cex = 1.5,
  xlab = "Mean carapace width (cm)",
  ylab = "Mean number of satellites")
#> Error in eval(m$data, eframe): object 'CrabSatellites' not found
