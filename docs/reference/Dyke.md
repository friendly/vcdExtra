# Sources of Knowledge of Cancer

Observational data on a sample of 1729 individuals, cross-classified in
a 2^5 table according to their sources of information (read newspapers,
listen to the radio, do 'solid' reading, attend lectures) and whether
they have good or poor knowledge regarding cancer. Knowledge of cancer
is often treated as the response.

## Format

A 5-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 5 variables for
1729 observations. The variable names and their levels are:

|     |             |                  |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| dim | Name        | Levels           |
| 1   | `Knowledge` | `"Good", "Poor"` |
| 2   | `Reading`   | `"No", "Yes"`    |
| 3   | `Radio`     | `"No", "Yes"`    |
| 4   | `Lectures`  | `"No", "Yes"`    |
| 5   | `Newspaper` | `"No", "Yes"`    |
