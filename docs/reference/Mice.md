# Mice Depletion Data

Data from Kastenbaum and Lamphiear (1959). The table gives the number of
depletions (deaths) in 657 litters of mice, classified by litter size
and treatment. This data set has become a classic in the analysis of
contingency tables, yet unfortunately little information on the details
of the experiment has been published.

## Format

A frequency data frame with 30 observations on the following 4
variables, representing a 5 x 2 x 3 contingency table.

- `litter`:

  litter size, a numeric vector

- `treatment`:

  treatment, a factor with levels `A` `B`

- `deaths`:

  number of depletions, a factor with levels `0` `1` `2+`

- `Freq`:

  cell frequency, a numeric vector

## Examples

``` r
data(Mice)
# make a table
ftable(mice.tab <- xtabs(Freq ~ litter + treatment + deaths, data=Mice))
#>                  deaths  0  1 2+
#> litter treatment                
#> 7      A                58 11  5
#>        B                75 19  7
#> 8      A                49 14 10
