## Source

The original R source for this dataset was compiled by Frank Harrell and
Robert Dawson: <https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/titanic.txt>, described
in more detail in <https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/titanic>

For this version of the Titanic data, passenger details were deleted,
survived was cast as a factor, and the name changed to `Titanicp` to
minimize confusion with other versions.

## Details

There are a number of related versions of the Titanic data, in various
formats. This version was derived from `ptitanic` in the rpart.plot
package, modifying it to remove the `Class 'labelled'` attributes for
some variables (inherited from Frank Harrell's `titanic3` version) which
caused problems with some applications, notably `ggplot2`.

Other versions:

[`Titanic`](https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/Titanic.html) is the 4-way
frequency table of all 2201 people aboard the Titanic, including
passengers and crew.

## Examples

``` r
data(Titanicp)
## maybe str(Titanicp) ; plot(Titanicp) ...
```
