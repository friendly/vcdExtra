# Household Tasks Performed by Husbands and Wives

A 13 x 4 table of frequencies of household tasks performed by couples,
either by the `Husband`, `Wife`, `Alternating` or `Jointly`.

## Format

The format is:

      'table' int [1:13, 1:4] 36 11 24 51 13 1 1 14 20 46 ...
    - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
    ..$ Task: chr [1:13] "Breakfast" "Dinner" "Dishes" "Driving" ...
    ..$ Who : chr [1:4] "Alternating" "Husband" "Jointly" "Wife"

## Source

This data set was taken from
[`housetasks`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/factoextra/man/housetasks.html), a 13
x 4 data.frame. In this table version, the rows and columns were sorted
alphabetically (and a typo was corrected).

## Examples

``` r
data(HouseTasks)
str(HouseTasks)
#>  'table' int [1:13, 1:4] 36 11 24 51 13 1 1 14 20 46 ...
#>  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#>   ..$ Task: chr [1:13] "Breakfast" "Dinner" "Dishes" "Driving" ...
#>   ..$ Who : chr [1:4] "Alternating" "Husband" "Jointly" "Wife"
