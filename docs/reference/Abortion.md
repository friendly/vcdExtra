# Abortion Opinion Data

Opinions about abortion classified by gender and SES

## Format

A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 3 variables for
1100 observations. The variable names and their levels are:

|     |                    |                    |
|-----|--------------------|--------------------|
| No  | Name               | Levels             |
| 1   | `Sex`              | `"Female", "Male"` |
| 2   | `Status`           | `"Lo", "Hi"`       |
| 3   | `Support_Abortion` | `"Yes", "No"`      |

## Details

`Support_Abortion` is a natural response variable.

The combinations of `Sex` and `Status` represent four independent
samples, having fixed `Sex`-`Status` marginal totals. There were 500
females and 600 males. Within the female group, 250 of low status and
250 of high status were sampled. Similarly for the males, with 300 in
each of the low and hgh status sub-groups.

This is an example of a product-multinomial sampling scheme. the
`Sex:Status` association must be included in any loglinear model where
the goal is to determine how attitude toward abortion depends on the
others.

Alternatively, a logit model for abortion support may provide a simpler
analysis.
