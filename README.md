## Extensions and additions to vcd: Visualizing Categorical Data

Version 0.8-0

This package provides additional data sets, documentation, and a few
functions designed to extend the
[vcd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcd) package for *Visualizing
Categorical Data* and the [gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm)
package for *Generalized Nonlinear Models*. In particular, `vcdExtra`
extends mosaic, assoc and sieve plots from vcd to handle `glm()` and
`gnm()` models and adds a 3D version in `mosaic3d()`.

`vcdExtra` is now a support package for the book [*Discrete Data
Analysis with
R*](https://www.routledge.com/Discrete-Data-Analysis-with-R-Visualization-and-Modeling-Techniques-for/Friendly-Meyer/p/book/9781498725835)
(DDAR) by Michael Friendly and David Meyer. There is also a [web site
for DDAR](http://ddar.datavis.ca) with all figures and code samples from
the book.

### Details

The main purpose of this package is to serve as a sandbox for
introducing extensions of mosaic plots and related graphical methods
that apply to loglinear models fitted using `glm()` and related,
generalized nonlinear models fitted with `gnm()` in the
[gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package. A related purpose
is to fill in some holes in the analysis of categorical data in R, not
provided in base R, [vcd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcd), or
other commonly used packages.

-   The method `mosaic.glm()` extends the `mosaic.loglm()` method in the
    vcd package to this wider class of models. This method also works
    for the generalized nonlinear models fit with the gnm package,
    including models for square tables and models with multiplicative
    associations.

-   `mosaic3d()` introduces a 3D generalization of mosaic displays using
    the [rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) package.

-   A new class, `glmlist`, is introduced for working with collections
    of glm objects, e.g., `Kway()` for fitting all K-way models from a
    basic marginal model, and `LRstats()` for brief statistical
    summaries of goodness-of-fit for a collection of models.

-   For **square tables** with ordered factors, `Crossings()`
    supplements the specification of terms in model formulas using
    `Symm()`, `Diag()`, `Topo(),` etc. in the
    [gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package.

-   In addition, there are

    -   many new data sets; use `datasets("vcdExtra")` to see a list;
    -   a [tutorial
        vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcdExtra/vignettes/vcd-tutorial.pdf).
        In the installed package, it can be viewed using
        `vignette("vcd-tutorial", package = "vcdExtra")`;
    -   a few useful utility functions for manipulating categorical data
        sets and working with models for categorical data.

## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

     install.packages("vcdExtra")

The development version can be installed to your R library directly from
the GitHub repo via:

     if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
     remotes::install_github("friendly/vcdExtra", build_vignettes = TRUE)

## Examples

The dataset `Mental` is a data frame frequency table representing the
cross-classification of mental health status (`mental`) of 1660 young
New York residents by their parentsâ€™ socioeconomic status (`ses`). Both
are *ordered* factors.

``` r
data(Mental)
str(Mental)
## 'data.frame':    24 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ ses   : Ord.factor w/ 6 levels "1"<"2"<"3"<"4"<..: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 ...
##  $ mental: Ord.factor w/ 4 levels "Well"<"Mild"<..: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 ...
##  $ Freq  : int  64 94 58 46 57 94 54 40 57 105 ...

# show as frequency table
(Mental.tab <- xtabs(Freq ~ ses+mental, data=Mental))
##    mental
## ses Well Mild Moderate Impaired
##   1   64   94       58       46
##   2   57   94       54       40
##   3   57  105       65       60
##   4   72  141       77       94
##   5   36   97       54       78
##   6   21   71       54       71
```

These examples illustrate fitting loglinear models using `glm()` and
models for *structured associations* taking ordinality into account.

#### Independence model

Fit the independence model, `Freq ~ mental+ses`. This does not take
ordinality into account.

``` r
indep <- glm(Freq ~ mental+ses,
             family = poisson, data = Mental)
LRstats(indep)
## Likelihood summary table:
##          AIC    BIC LR Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq)    
## indep 209.59 220.19   47.418 15  3.155e-05 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

`mosaic.glm()` is the mosaic method for `glm` objects. The default
mosaic display for these data:

``` r
mosaic(indep)
```

![](man/figures/README-mental1-1.png)<!-- -->

It is usually better to use standardized residuals in mosaic displays.
Here we also add longer labels for the table factors and display the
values of residuals in the cells.

The formula, `~ ses + mental` here gives the order of the factors in the
mosaic display, not the statistical model for independence. That is, the
unit square is first split by `ses`, then by `mental` within each level
of `ses`.

``` r
# labels for table factors
long.labels <- list(set_varnames = c(mental="Mental Health Status", 
                                     ses="Parent SES"))

mosaic(indep, ~ ses + mental,
       residuals_type="rstandard",
       labeling_args = long.labels, 
       labeling=labeling_residuals)
```

![](man/figures/README-mental2-1.png)<!-- -->

the opposite-corner pattern of the residuals clearly shows that
association between Parent SES and mental health depends on the ordered
levels of the factors.

#### Ordinal models

Ordinal models use numeric scores for the row and/or column variables.
The simplest models use equally spaced integer scores.

Using these, the term `Rscore:Cscore` represents an association
constrained to be **linear x linear**; that is, the slopes for mental
health status is assumed to vary linearly with Parent SES.

``` r
# fit linear x linear (uniform) association.  Use integer scores for rows/cols 
Cscore <- as.numeric(Mental$ses)
Rscore <- as.numeric(Mental$mental)

linlin <- glm(Freq ~ mental + ses + Rscore:Cscore,
              family = poisson, data = Mental)
mosaic(linlin, ~ ses + mental,
       residuals_type="rstandard", 
       labeling_args = long.labels, 
       labeling=labeling_residuals, 
       suppress=1, 
       gp=shading_Friendly,
       main="Lin x Lin model")
```

![](man/figures/README-mental3-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the test for linear x linear association consumes only 1
degree of freedom, compared to the `(r-1)*(c-1) = 15` degrees of freedom
for general association.

``` r
anova(linlin, test="Chisq")
## Analysis of Deviance Table

```

Other models are possible between the independence model,
`Freq ~ mental + ses`, and the saturated model
`Freq ~ mental + ses + mental:ses`. The `update.glm()` method make these
easy to specify, as addition of terms to the independence model.

``` r
# use update.glm method to fit other models

linlin <- update(indep, . ~ . + Rscore:Cscore)
roweff <- update(indep, . ~ . + mental:Cscore)
coleff <- update(indep, . ~ . + Rscore:ses)
rowcol <- update(indep, . ~ . + Rscore:ses + mental:Cscore)
```

**Compare the models**: For `glm` objects, the `print` and `summary`
methods give too much information if all one wants to see is a brief
summary of model goodness of fit, and there is no easy way to display a
compact comparison of model goodness of fit for a collection of models
fit to the same data.

`LRstats()` provides a brief summary for one or more models fit to the
same dataset. The likelihood ratio
![\\chi^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Cchi%5E2 "\chi^2")
values (`LR Chisq`)test lack of fit. By these tests, none of the ordinal
models show significant lack of fit. By the AIC and BIC statistics, the
`linlin` model is the best, combining parsimony and goodness of fit.

``` r
LRstats(indep, linlin, roweff, coleff, rowcol)
## Likelihood summary table:
##           AIC    BIC LR Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq)    
## indep  209.59 220.19   47.418 15  3.155e-05 ***
## linlin 174.07 185.85    9.895 14     0.7698    
## roweff 174.45 188.59    6.281 12     0.9013    
## coleff 179.00 195.50    6.829 10     0.7415    
## rowcol 179.22 198.07    3.045  8     0.9315    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

The `anova.glm()` function gives tests of nested models.

``` r
anova(indep, linlin, roweff, test = "Chisq")
