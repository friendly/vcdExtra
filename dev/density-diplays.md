# Density Displays for Categorical Data
#
These are notes for an article using `labeling_points()` to illustrate the idea of using density of points
as another visual attribute for frequency tables.

A more general title might be: "Visual Attributes for Categorical Data"



## Intro

Tables of the frequencies of observations, classified by one or more factors, are the bread-and-butter of
categorical data analysis... [add some examples]

### simple numeric tables

- heatmap shading: show the numbers in the cells but show their magnitudes by shading the background in the table. 
  - How to do these in R: tinytable can color the backgrounds of cells; various heatmap functions.
  - shading by residual from a model: This is used in the examples of the online mosaics app for the sample datasets

### area proportional displays

- tile plots, assocplot, sieve diagrams, mosaic plots
