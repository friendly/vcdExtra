\description{
A two-way contingency table formed from the cross-classification of the
number of years of occupational exposure to asbestos and the diagnosed
severity of asbestosis of 1117 New York workers. Asbestosis is a chronic
lung disease that results in the lung tissue being scared due to contact
with the fibers which can lead to severe breathing difficulties.
}
\details{
\code{exposure} and \code{grade} should be regarded as ordered factors. Beh
and Lombardo (2022) use this data to illustrate a polynomial biplot for
ordered categories.

The data summarized here was studied by Beh and Smith (2011) and comes from
the original data collected and published by Selikoff (1981) who examined
the link between asbestos exposure and asbestosis severity in 1963.
