\description{
The Alligator data, from Agresti (2002), comes from a study of the primary
food choices of alligators in four Florida lakes. Researchers classified the
stomach contents of 219 captured alligators into five categories: Fish (the
most common primary food choice), Invertebrate (snails, insects, crayfish,
etc.), Reptile (turtles, alligators), Bird, and Other (amphibians, plants,
household pets, stones, and other debris).
}
\details{
The table contains a fair number of 0 counts.

\code{food} is the response variable.  \code{fish} is the most frequent
choice, and often taken as a baseline category in multinomial response
models.
