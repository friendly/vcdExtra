\title{Burt (1950) Data on Hair, Eyes, Head and Stature}
\format{
A frequency data frame (representing a 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 frequency
table) with 36 cells on the following 5 variables.
\describe{
  \item{list("Hair")}{hair color, a factor with levels \code{Fair} \code{Red} \code{Dark}}
  \item{list("Eyes")}{eye color, a factor with levels \code{Light} \code{Mixed} \code{Dark}}
  \item{list("Head")}{head shape, a factor with levels \code{Narrow} \code{Wide}}
  \item{list("Stature")}{height, a factor with levels \code{Tall} \code{Short}}
  \item{list("Freq")}{a numeric vector}
}

\description{
Cyril Burt (1950) gave these data, on a sample of 100 people from Liverpool,
to illustrate the application of a method of factor analysis (later called
multiple correspondence analysis) applied to categorical data.
}
\details{
He presented these data initially in the form that has come to be called a
"Burt table", giving the univariate and bivariate frequencies for an n-way
frequency table.

Burt says: "In all, 217 individuals were examined, about two-thirds of them
males. But, partly to simplify the calculations and partly because the later
observations were rather more trustworthy, I shall here restrict my analysis
to the data obtained from the last hundred males in the series."

\code{Head} and \code{Stature} reflect a binary coding where people are
classified according to whether they are below or above the average for the
population.
