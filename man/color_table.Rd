  expected = NULL,
  palette = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A table, xtabs, matrix, ftable, or structable object}

\item{formula}{Formula specifying row ~ col layout (passed to structable if needed)}

\item{shade}{What values determine cell shading: "residuals" (default), "freq",
"pearson", or "deviance"}

\item{model}{A fitted model (loglm or glm) to compute residuals from.
If NULL and shade involves residuals, uses independence model.}

\item{expected}{Expected frequencies (alternative to model)}

\item{palette}{Color palette function or vector. Default depends on shade type.}

\item{legend}{Logical, show color legend/scale?}

\item{margins}{Logical, include row/column totals?}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places for displayed values}

\item{title}{Optional table title}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A gt table object that can be further customized
}
\description{
Creates a formatted table display of frequency data with cell backgrounds
colored according to observed frequencies or their residuals from a loglinear model.
}
\details{
This function provides a heatmap-style representation of a frequency table,
where background coloring is used to visualize patterns and anomalies in the data.
When shading by residuals (the default), cells with large positive residuals
(more observations than expected) are shaded red, while cells with large negative
residuals (fewer than expected) are shaded blue. This makes it easy to identify
cells that deviate substantially from what would be expected under a given model
(by default, the independence model).

For cells with dark background colors, black text can be difficult to read.
This function automatically selects white or black text for each cell based
on which provides better contrast against the background color. If the
\pkg{colorspace} package is available, \code{\link[colorspace]{contrast_ratio}}
is used to determine the optimal text color according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
Otherwise, a fallback based on relative luminance (ITU-R BT.709) is used.

\dontrun{
# Basic usage - shade by residuals from independence
data(HairEyeColor)
HEC <- margin.table(HairEyeColor, 2:1)
color_table(HEC)

# Shade by frequencies instead
color_table(HEC, shade = "freq")

# 3-way table
color_table(HairEyeColor, formula = Eye ~ Hair + Sex)
}
