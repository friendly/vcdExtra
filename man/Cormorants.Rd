\title{Advertising Behavior by Males Cormorants}
\format{
A data frame with 343 observations on the following 8 variables.

  \item{\code{nest}}{Type of nest, an ordered factor with levels \code{no} < \code{partial} < \code{full}}
  \item{\code{height}}{Relative height of bird in the tree, an ordered factor with levels \code{low} < \code{mid} < \code{high}}
  \item{\code{density}}{Number of other nests in the tree, an ordered factor with levels \code{zero} < \code{few} < \code{moderate} < \code{high}}

\description{
Male double-crested cormorants use advertising behavior to attract females
for breeding. In this study by Meagan McRae (2015), cormorants were observed
two or three times a week at six stations in a tree-nesting colony for an
entire season, April 10, 2014-July 10, 2014. The number of advertising birds
was counted and these observations were classified by characteristics of the
trees and nests.
