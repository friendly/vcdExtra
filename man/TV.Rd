\title{TV Viewing Data}

\description{
  This data set \code{TV} comprises a 5 x 11 x 3 contingency table based on
  audience viewing data from Neilsen Media Research for the week starting
  November 6, 1995.
}

\usage{data(TV)}
\format{
  A 5 x 11 x 3 array of cell frequencies with the following structure:
\preformatted{
 int [1:5, 1:11, 1:3] 146 244 233 174 294 151 181 161 183 281 ...
 - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 3
  ..$ Day    : chr [1:5] "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" ...
  ..$ Time   : chr [1:11] "8:00" "8:15" "8:30" "8:45" ...
  ..$ Network: chr [1:3] "ABC" "CBS" "NBC"
}
}

\details{
The original data, \code{tv.dat}, contains two additional networks: "Fox" and "Other", with small
frequencies. These levels were removed in the current version.
There is also a fourth factor, transition State
transition (turn the television Off, Switch channels, or Persist in viewing the current channel).
The \code{TV} data here includes only the Persist observations.
}

\source{
The original data, \code{tv.dat}, came from the initial implementation of 
mosaic displays in R by Jay Emerson (1998). Similar data had been used by
Hartigan and Kleiner (1984) as an illustration.
