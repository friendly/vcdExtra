\description{
This data set, from Efron and Thisted (1976), gives the number of distinct
words types (\code{Freq}) of words that appeared exactly once, twice, etc.
up to 100 times (\code{count}) in the complete works of Shakespeare.  In
these works, Shakespeare used 31,534 distinct words (types), comprising
884,647 words in total.
}
\details{
Efron & Thisted used this data to ask the question, "How many words did
Shakespeare know?"  Put another way, suppose another new corpus of works
Shakespeare were discovered, also with 884,647 words. How many new word
types would appear? The answer to the main question involves contemplating
an infinite number of such new corpora.

In addition to the words that appear \code{1:100} times, there are 846 words
that appear more than 100 times, not listed in this data set.
