\details{
Both table variables can be considered ordinal. The variable \code{visit}
refers to visiting patterns recorded hospital.  The category labels are
abbreviations of those given by Goodman (1983); e.g., \code{"Regular"} is
short for \dQuote{received visitors regularly or patient went home}. The
variable \code{stay} refers to length of stay in hospital, in year groups.
