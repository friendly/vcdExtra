\description{
This data set gives the results of the 1970 US draft lottery, in the form of
a frequency table. The rows are months of the year, Jan--Dec and columns
give the number of days in that month which fall into each of three draft
risk categories High, Medium, and Low, corresponding to the chances of being
called to serve in the US army.
}
\details{
The lottery numbers are divided into three categories of risk of being
called for the draft -- High, Medium, and Low -- each representing roughly
one third of the days in a year.  Those birthdays having the highest risk
have lottery numbers 1-122, medium risk have numbers 123-244, and the lowest
risk category contains lottery numbers 245-366.
