\title{Average Residuals within Factor Levels}
\description{
  Computes the mean working residual from a model fitted using
  Iterative Weighted Least Squares for each level of a factor or
  interaction of factors.

\usage{meanResiduals(object, by, standardized=TRUE, as.table=TRUE, ...)}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{model object for which \code{object$residuals} gives the
    working residuals and \code{object$weights} gives the working weights.}
  \item{by}{a list of factors.}
  \item{standardized}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, the mean residuals are
    standardized to be approximately standard normal.}
  \item{as.table}{logical: if \code{TRUE} the result is returned as a table
    cross-classified by the factors passed to \code{by}.}
  \item{...}{currently ignored}

\value{If \code{as.table == TRUE}, the mean residuals cross-classified
  by the factors passed to \code{by}, otherwise a vector of mean residuals.
  In either case the returned object has a single attribute,
  \code{"weights"} which gives the weight associated with each
  grouped residual.}
