\title{
Publications of PhD Candidates
}
\description{
A data set giving the number of publications by doctoral candidates in biochemistry
in relation to various predictors, originally from Long (1997).

There is a large number of zero counts. Is there evidence for
a separate group of non-publishers?
}
\usage{data(PhdPubs)}
\format{
  A data frame with 915 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{articles}}{number of articles published in the final three years of PhD studies}
    \item{\code{female}}{dummy variable for gender, coded \code{1} for female}
    \item{\code{married}}{dummy variable for marital status, coded \code{1} for married}
    \item{\code{kid5}}{number of young children, age 5 and under}
    \item{\code{phdprestige}}{prestige of the PhD department.  The higher the number the more prestigious the program. }
    \item{\code{mentor}}{number of publications by the mentor in the preceeding three years}
  }
}
\details{
In this version of the data set, \code{phdprestige} had been rounded to the nearest integer.
A Stata version with the continuous values was subsequently found at
