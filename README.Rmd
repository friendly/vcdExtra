## Extensions and additions to vcd: Visualizing Categorical Data 

Version 0.8-2

This package provides additional data sets, documentation, and
a few functions designed to extend the [vcd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcd) package for *Visualizing Categorical Data*
and the [gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package for *Generalized Nonlinear Models*. 
In particular, `vcdExtra` extends mosaic, assoc and sieve plots from vcd to handle `glm()` and 
`gnm()` models and
adds a 3D version in `mosaic3d()`.

`vcdExtra` is a support package for the book [*Discrete Data Analysis with R*](https://www.routledge.com/Discrete-Data-Analysis-with-R-Visualization-and-Modeling-Techniques-for/Friendly-Meyer/p/book/9781498725835) (DDAR) by Michael Friendly and David Meyer. There is also a
[web site for DDAR](http://ddar.datavis.ca) with all figures and code samples from the book.
It is also used in my graduate course, [Psy 6136: Catgegorical Data Analysis](https://friendly.github.io/psy6136/).

### Details

The main purpose of this package is to serve as a sandbox for
introducing extensions of
mosaic plots and related graphical methods
that apply to loglinear models fitted using
`glm()` and related, generalized nonlinear models fitted
with `gnm()` in the [gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package.
A related purpose is to fill in some holes in the analysis of
categorical data in R, not provided in base R, [vcd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcd), 
or other commonly used packages.

* The method `mosaic.glm()` 
extends the `mosaic.loglm()` method in the vcd
package to this wider class of models.  This method also works for
the generalized nonlinear models fit with the gnm package,
including models for square tables and models with multiplicative associations.

* `mosaic3d()`
introduces a 3D generalization of mosaic displays using the
[rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) package.

* A new class, `glmlist`, is introduced for working with
collections of glm objects, e.g., `Kway()` for fitting
all K-way models from a basic marginal model, and `LRstats()`
for brief statistical summaries of goodness-of-fit for a collection of
models.

* For **square tables** with ordered factors, `Crossings()` supplements the 
specification of terms in model formulas using
`Symm()`,
`Diag()`, 
`Topo(),` etc. in the [gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package.

* In addition, there are: 
  + many new data sets; use `datasets("vcdExtra")` to see a list with titles and descriptions

```{r vcdExtra-datasets}
vcdExtra::datasets("vcdExtra")[,1]
```

  + a [collection of tutorial vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcdExtra/vignettes/). In the installed package, they can be viewed using `browseVignettes(package = "vcdExtra")`;

```{r vignettes}
tools::getVignetteInfo("vcdExtra")[,c("File", "Title")]
```

  + a few useful utility functions for manipulating categorical data sets and working with models for
categorical data. 


## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

     install.packages("vcdExtra")

The development version can be installed to your R library directly from the GitHub repo via:

     if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
     remotes::install_github("friendly/vcdExtra", build_vignettes = TRUE)

## Examples

The dataset `Mental` is a data frame frequency table representing the cross-classification of mental health status (`mental`) of 1660 young New York residents by their parents' socioeconomic status (`ses`).
Both are _ordered_ factors.

```{r ex-mental1}
data(Mental)
str(Mental)

# show as frequency table
(Mental.tab <- xtabs(Freq ~ ses+mental, data=Mental))
```


These examples illustrate fitting loglinear models using `glm()` and models for _structured associations_ taking
ordinality into account.


#### Independence model
Fit the independence model, `Freq ~ mental+ses`. This does not take ordinality into account.
```{r ex-mental2}
indep <- glm(Freq ~ mental+ses,
             family = poisson, data = Mental)
LRstats(indep)
```

`mosaic.glm()` is the mosaic method for `glm` objects.
The default mosaic display for these data:
```{r mental1}
mosaic(indep)
```

It is usually better to use standardized residuals in mosaic displays.
Here we also add longer labels for the table factors and display the
values of residuals in the cells. 

The formula, `~ ses + mental`
here gives the order of the factors in the mosaic display,
not the statistical model for independence. That is, the
unit square is first split by `ses`, then by `mental` within
each level of `ses`.
```{r mental2}
# labels for table factors
long.labels <- list(set_varnames = c(mental="Mental Health Status", 
                                     ses="Parent SES"))

mosaic(indep, ~ ses + mental,
       residuals_type="rstandard",
       labeling_args = long.labels, 
       labeling=labeling_residuals)
```

the opposite-corner pattern of the residuals clearly shows that association
between Parent SES and mental health depends on the ordered levels of the factors.

#### Ordinal models
Ordinal models use numeric scores for the row and/or column variables.
The simplest models use equally spaced integer scores.

Using these, the term `Rscore:Cscore` represents an association
constrained to be **linear x linear**; that is, the slopes for
mental health status is assumed to vary linearly with Parent SES.

```{r mental3}
# fit linear x linear (uniform) association.  Use integer scores for rows/cols 
Cscore <- as.numeric(Mental$ses)
Rscore <- as.numeric(Mental$mental)

linlin <- glm(Freq ~ mental + ses + Rscore:Cscore,
              family = poisson, data = Mental)
mosaic(linlin, ~ ses + mental,
       residuals_type="rstandard", 
       labeling_args = long.labels, 
       labeling=labeling_residuals, 
       suppress=1, 
       gp=shading_Friendly,
       main="Lin x Lin model")
```

Note that the test for linear x linear association consumes only 1 degree of freedom,
compared to the `(r-1)*(c-1) = 15` degrees of freedom for general association.
```{r}
anova(linlin, test="Chisq")
```


Other models are possible between the independence model, `Freq ~ mental + ses`,
and the saturated model `Freq ~ mental + ses + mental:ses`.
The `update.glm()` method make these easy to specify, as addition of terms to
the independence model.
```{r}
# use update.glm method to fit other models

linlin <- update(indep, . ~ . + Rscore:Cscore)
roweff <- update(indep, . ~ . + mental:Cscore)
coleff <- update(indep, . ~ . + Rscore:ses)
rowcol <- update(indep, . ~ . + Rscore:ses + mental:Cscore)
```

**Compare the models**: 
For `glm` objects, the `print` and `summary` methods give too much information if all one wants to see is a brief summary of model goodness of fit, and there is no easy way to display a compact comparison of model goodness of fit for a collection of models fit to the same data.

`LRstats()` provides a brief summary for one or more models fit to the same dataset.
The likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ values (`LR Chisq`)test lack of fit.
By these tests, none of the ordinal models show significant lack of fit.
By the AIC and BIC statistics, the `linlin` model is the best, combining parsimony and goodness of fit.
```{r}
LRstats(indep, linlin, roweff, coleff, rowcol)
```
The `anova.glm()` function gives tests of nested models.
```{r}
anova(indep, linlin, roweff, test = "Chisq")

```
